## Description

This is a simple single-view application that takes 2 parameters; an apiKey (generated at http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) and a search query; to retrieve a list of movies/series from IMDB through the OMDb API.

The application is setup so that pagination is handled automatically as you scroll through the list, loading more items as necessary.

I decided to use UIKit with a view code approach in this project after a few attempts using SwiftUI that caused too many glaring performance issues.
